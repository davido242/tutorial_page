			Compliment of the season Boss!
			I give credit to God who has been my strenght in the zeal to keep moving by giving me the oppurtunity to get mentorship, advices and motivation through you Sir!
			From the researches and videos watched regarding the requirements on the roadmap of a developer, it is obvious that you have given me all necessary advice and materials to start and get to the top! I remain greateful!!
			Please accept this expression amongst my seasional appreciation which signifies my progress in Dev World in relation to the past.
			Most at times, your busy schedule makes me feel like you have given up on me due to too much immature questions and enlightenment I do request, but you always surprise me at the right time with enough of the answers with cause and effect from experience!
			Finally, you have proven that the most relevant softwares and materials needed in Dev World are usually free and Demands just an individual determination and patience to develop oneself!
			Once more, I appreciate your mentorship Sir!.
			Happy Christmas and a Blessed New Year in Advance!!

					<ul>
								- How to monitor your applications
- How to alert on faults and errors
- 		How to isolate an error to its root cause

You’ll need error fixing skills:

- How to debug code by bisecting errors
- How to read logs output
- How to set up test environments to recreate errors

You’ll need some help:

- Social skills to work in a team
- Clean coding skills to allow team mates to change your code

You’ll want your code safe:

- How to use Version control systems
- Versioning strategies
- Safe upgrade strategies

You’ll most likely want it on the web:

- How the web works
- How to make web user interfaces
- How to talk to other applications across the web
- Web security to keep out attackers
- How to handle network failures

The programming language part is definitely the first place to start. But you’ll end up doing all those other things because that’s what makes up a whole application.

It’s a lot to learn - but take it step by step, learn each day, apply everything you learn and work towards building a medium-sized application on your own.
